            <h2>Improving Insomnia in People Living with Schizophrenia</h2>
            <h3>About Schizophrenia and Insomnia</h3>
            <p>
                Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects 1% of the adult population.
                Symptoms include hallucination, delusion, and amotivation. 30 to 40% of People Living with Schizophrenia (PLwS)
                have comorbid insomnia. Insomnia and schizophrenia can easily fall into a negative feedback loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most popular and effective treatment to insomnia is Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-i).
                However,CBT-i is difficult for PLwS, whom often have cognitive decline and reduced memory, to adhere, as it requires active sleep diary keeping and remembering sleep and wake up times.
            </p>
            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>
                As an undergraduate researcher and a full-stack developer at the Lee Lab @ UC San Diego,
                our lab's goal is to create a mobile CBT-i application that can aid PLwS with CBT-i.
                We developed a mobile application that leverages commercially available sleep trackers
                (Fitbit watch and Withings sleep mat) to record sleep and to provide help based on the collected data.
            </p>
            <p>
                We used Flutter for frontend and IBM Cloud for backend. I directly contributed to developing layouts and widgets
                on the frontend and database storage in the backend.
            </p>

                Our research was selected for presentation at the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry Conference.
